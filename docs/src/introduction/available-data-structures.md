# Available Data Structures

The library provides several stable data structures:

* **BTreeMap**: A key-value store that maintains keys in sorted order
* **BTreeSet**: A B-Tree set implementation that stores its data into a designated memory.
* **Vec**: A growable array
* **Log**: An append-only list of variable-size entries
* **Cell**: A serializable value
* **MinHeap**: A priority queue
