# Stable structures

This repository contains a library designed for developing canisters on the [Internet Computer](https://internetcomputer.org).
The library provides a collection of data structures designed to directly use [stable memory](https://sdk.dfinity.org/docs/interface-spec/index.html#system-api-stable-memory) as the backing store.
